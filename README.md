## Clarifai - The Machine Learning API 
This app makes use of the **Clarifai Face Detect Model** that returns probability scores on the likelihood that the image submitted contains human faces and coordinate locations of where those faces appear with a bounding box.

## Security
User information is protected with a powerful and trusted password hashing service and stored in a secure database that's not prone to SQL-injection attacks. With Heroku's SSL the app is a lot more secure.
